# CSSBattle Challenges

This repo contains my solutions for CSS challenges on [cssbattle.dev](https://cssbattle.dev).

The objective is to achieve the target image in the smallest amount of characters of HTML and CSS code as possible.

## Structure

For each battle (set of challenges) I have completed there is a directory of name:

`<battle no.>_<battle name>`

Inside those, for each challenge I have completed there is:

* High-score version (minified): `<target no.>_<target name>_hi.html`

* High-score version (pretty-print): `<target no.>_<target name>_pretty.html`
